mind-machine
============
React components for building mind-machines for web and [Google Cardboard][].  Still under active development.  Inspired from the code found at https://github.com/chrisallenlane/mind-machine.

**WARNING: This application may potentially trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.**

About
-----

[Wikipedia][mind-machines]:

> A mind machine (aka brain machine or light and sound machine) uses pulsing
> rhythmic sound, flashing light, electrical or magnetic fields, or a
> combination of these, to alter the frequency of the user's brainwaves. Mind
> machines can induce deep states of relaxation, concentration, and in some
> cases altered states of consciousness, which have been compared to those
> obtained from meditation and shamanic exploration. Photic mind machines work
> with flickering lights embedded in sunglasses.

More information on building mind machines can be found in [this article from _Make Magazine_][make].


Usage
-----
1. Run either `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.  If you don't have node, install guides can be found via google for your platform.

2. Run `yarn start` or `npm start`.  This will spin up the server via parcel, build and bundle your code, and serve it.



Safety
------
[WikiPedia][safety]:

> Rapidly flashing lights may be dangerous for people with photosensitive
> epilepsy or other nervous disorders. It is thought that one out of 10,000
> adults will experience a seizure while viewing such a device; about twice as
> many children will have a similar ill effect.
